## 🎯 What is this?
**ADBlock-Private-DNS (ADBlock-PD)** is a fork of the popular AdGuard Home DNS server (based on v0.107.74). Created by **Weby Homelab**, the sole purpose of this project is to **completely sever all ties with AdGuard's infrastructure (and any other external entity)**. We took a powerful filtering engine and fully "sanitized" it.

Your DNS server should belong exclusively to you. No telemetry, no hidden requests, and no downloading of third-party code without your explicit consent.

## ✨ Key Hardening Features

### 🚀 Purged Updater (RCE Protection)
The original `internal/updater` module has been physically removed from the source code. The server will **never** ping `static.adtidy.org` to check for updates. This eliminates a potential Remote Code Execution (RCE) vector through compromised updates or malicious infrastructure.

### 🔒 DNS Hardening & Zero Phone-Home
- **SafeBrowsing & Parental Control:** In the original version, these features send hashes of your queries to AdGuard servers. In **ADBlock-PD**, the suffixes are nullified, and requests are forcefully redirected to `127.0.0.1`. The features are isolated.
- **WHOIS Privacy:** The built-in WHOIS client has been replaced with a dummy stub (`whois.Empty`). The IP addresses of devices in your network are never transmitted to external servers (e.g., `whois.arin.net`).

### 🔇 Zero Telemetry & Rebranding
All links in the web interface (React) that led to AdGuard trackers, analytics, or external documentation have been replaced with neutral stubs. The project has received a new adaptive SVG logo and a complete visual identity overhaul.

### 🔄 Self-Healing Architecture
The container is equipped with a built-in `HEALTHCHECK` based on the `host` utility. Every 30 seconds, the system verifies the vitality of the DNS resolver (`127.0.0.1:53`). If the service hangs, Docker will automatically restart it, guaranteeing a stable internet connection in your network.

### 🐧 Lightweight & Secure Base
The final Docker image is based on `debian:bullseye-slim`. The service runs as an unprivileged user (`UID 10001`), utilizing the `--no-permcheck` flag for a secure startup in an isolated Docker environment. The default timezone is set to `Europe/Kyiv`.

## 🚀 Quick Start (Docker)

The recommended way to deploy ADBlock-PD is via Docker.

### Option 1: Docker CLI

```bash
docker run -d --name adblock-pd \
  -v $(pwd)/data:/opt/adblock-pd/data \
  -v $(pwd)/conf:/opt/adblock-pd/conf \
  -p 53:53/udp -p 53:53/tcp \
  -p 80:80/tcp -p 3000:3000/tcp \
  -p 443:443/tcp -p 443:443/udp \
  -p 853:853/tcp -p 853:853/udp \
  --restart always \
  webyhomelab/adblock-pd:latest
```

### Option 2: Docker Compose

Create a `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
version: "3.8"
services:
  adblock-pd:
    image: webyhomelab/adblock-pd:latest
    container_name: adblock-pd
    restart: always
    ports:
      - "53:53/tcp"
      - "53:53/udp"
      - "80:80/tcp"        # Web Admin
      - "3000:3000/tcp"    # Initial Setup Wizard
      - "443:443/tcp"      # DoH / HTTPS
      - "443:443/udp"      # HTTP/3
      - "853:853/tcp"      # DoT
      - "853:853/udp"      # DoQ
    volumes:
      - ./data:/opt/adblock-pd/data
      - ./conf:/opt/adblock-pd/conf
```

Run it:
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

> **Note:** After the first launch, navigate to `http://<your-ip>:3000` to complete the initial setup wizard.

## 🛠 Building from Source

If you want to build the project yourself, you will need Docker (for the multi-stage build process).

```bash
git clone https://github.com/weby-homelab/adblock-pd.git
cd adblock-pd
docker build -t adblock-pd:local .
```
